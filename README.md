# Chlorine Web REPL

Web REPL for Clojure/ChlorineJS

Chlorine (formerly Clojurejs) is a naive implementation of a Clojure subset language to Javascript translator.

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```
See it online at: http://web-repl.herokuapp.com/

You will see a terminal box, just check this:
```
$ (map inc (range 200))
```
and see the result. Remember, the script is run in **your** browser. You have been warned :)
